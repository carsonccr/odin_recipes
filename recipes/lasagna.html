  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
      <li>2 pounds fresh chorizo sausage meat</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cup tomato puree, divided</li>
      <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
      <li>2 cups ricotta</li>
      <li>1 cup queso fresco</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmesan</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fresh ground pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>16 to 20 uncooked lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>2 cups grated mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat canola oil in a large pan over medium high heat. Crumble chorizo into the pan and cook until caramelized and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Add in 1 cup of the tomato puree and beef stock. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium and simmer until mixture reduces into a thick sauce, about 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, mix ricotta, quesa fresco, and eggs in a large bowl. Stir until combined and smooth. Stir in parmesan cheese and pepper.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 13Ã—9 inch pan. Cover with uncooked lasagna noodles, breaking them as needed to create a single layer.</li>
      <li>Dollop cheese mixture over noodles, then sprinkle mozzarella and 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano. Arrange another layer of noodles over cheese, then ladle meat sauce followed by cheese mixture, mozzarella and oregano. Repeat two more times, then dollop remaining tomato puree over the top layer of mozzarella.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are browning and top layer is bubbling, about an hour. Let rest for about 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
